I am committed to my family, department, and community to which I serve.

I am calm and alert in potentially dangerous and stressful situations.

I never give up and I will survive a deadly conflict.

I treat others like I would like to be treated.

I am courageous, honorable, and always act with integrity.

I do the right thing for the right reasons.
