**CODE OF ETHICS**

As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve; to safeguard lives and property. To protect the innocent against deception,
the weak against oppression or intimidation, and the peaceful against violence or disorder. And to respect the Constitutional rights of all
to liberty, equality, or justice.

I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all; maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule; develop
self-restraint; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Honest in thought and deed in both my personal and official life, I will
be exemplary in obeying the laws of the land and the regulations of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature
or is confided in me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret, unless revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty.

I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, animosities or friendships to influence my decisions. With no
compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor,
malice or ill will, never employing for or violence, and never accepting gratuities.

I recognize the badge of office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust so long as I am true to the ethics of police
service. I will constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself before God to my chosen profession... law
enforcement.

I am calm and alert in potentially dangerous and stressful situations.

I never give up and I will survive a deadly conflict.

I treat others like I would like to be treated.

I am courageous, honorable, and always act with integrity.

I do the right thing for the right reasons.

I have pride in my performance and postive expectations of my duty to service.

I am accountable for the results of my decisions and actions.

**SECTION L 2638 DIRECT USE OF FIREARM:**

- When discharged in a safe manner at an approved range.

  that poses an immediate threat to any person or other animal, and other dispositions are impractical.

  against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to another person.

- When based on the totality of the circumstances, deadly force is necessary to effect the capture of, or prevent the

  serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended.
