PC's:
REASONABLE SUSPICION (BoK):

If an officer has a reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed, is committing or is about to commit any crime, such officer
has the authority to stop that individual and conduct a Street Check. The officer may exercise this authority in any place that the officer
has a right to be. Both pedestrians and individuals in vehicles may be stopped. The following elements must be present before a Street Check is authorized:

- The officer has reasonable suspicion that some unusual or out of the ordinary activity is or has taken place

- There is some indication that the individual under suspicion is connected to the unusual activity

- There is some suggestion that the unusual activity is related to crime

All three elements must be present before an individual is stopped and a Street Check is performed.

PROBABLE CAUSE (Section L 2803)(BoK):
"Reasonable cause to believe" is a phrase that describes the amount of evidence - facts observed, information from others, personal
knowledge - that would be sufficient to lead an ordinary and prudent person to reasonably believe that a crime is occurring or has occurred and that the person to be arrested committed such a crime or is committing a crime.

Reasonable Suspicion:
A specific set of describable facts or circumstances that would cause a reasonable officer, of like training and experience, to suspect that:

- Suspicious activity is afoot, and
- The person to be detained is connected to that activity, and
- The activity may be related to a crime.

Probable Cause:
A specific set of describable facts or circumstances that would cause a reasonable person of ordinary care and prudence (or a reasonable officer, of like training and experience), to entertain an honest and strong belief that the person to be arrested is guilty of a crime.

835 PC: METHOD OF ARREST

- An arrest is made by actual restraint of the person or by submission to the custody of the officer.
- Reasonable restraint for the arrest or detention may be used.

835a PC - EFFECTING ARREST; RESISTANCE

- Any peace officer who has reasonable suspicious to suspect that the person to be arrested is guilty of committing a public crime
- may use objectively reasonable force to:
  a. effect the arrest, or
  b. to prevent escape, or
  c. to overcome resistance

484 PC: Theft (defined)

- The taking and
- carrying away of
- the personal property of another
- without consent
- with intent to permanently deprive the owner

487(a) PC: GRAND THEFT (FELONY)

- Theft of any item exceeding a value of $950

488 PC: PETTY THEFT (MISDEMEANOR)

- Theft in other cases is considered petty theft

211 PC: Robbery (Felony)

- Taking of the personal property of another
- from the person or immediate presence
- against the person's will
- by means of force or fear.

215 PC: Carjacking (Felony)

- Taking of a motor vehicle
- from a person or immediate presence
- of the possessor or passenger
- by means of force or fear
- with intent to either temporarily or permanently deprive the possessor or passenger.

240PC: Assault (Misdemeanor)

- Unlawful attempt,
- and the present ability,
- to commit a violent injury
- upon the person of another

242 PC: Battery (Misdemeanor)
